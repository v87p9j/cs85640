Engineering Ethics for a Just and Diverse World 
PHIL 2332 (35106) | Three Credit Hours 
Tues, Thurs 2:20-3:40PM 
Mendenhall Lab 131
Course Description 
This course provides students in engineering and technology fields analytical and critical tools to help them design and build for a diverse and just world. Codes of ethics—such as the NSPE Code of Ethics for Engineers—encapsulate the demands of citizenship on engineers in their professional capacities. These codes prioritize safety, health, and welfare—but what do these require in a diverse world marked by racial, ethnic, gender, and other inequalities? How has technology and its regulation shaped our society and environment, domestically and globally? What ethical and professional responsibilities do engineers in the United States have to diverse communities at home and abroad, and how can they work collaboratively and inclusively? This course will provide students the ability to understand and critically engage racial equity and social justice challenges, to identify and analyze moral problems from different ethical perspectives, and to navigate relationships between personal values and the demands of citizenship in a diverse and just world.
Prerequisites: GE Foundations in Writing and Information Literacy; Race, Ethnicity and Gender; Historical and Cultural Studies; and GE Foundations in Historical and Cultural Studies.
Course goals 
1.   Students will develop an advanced understanding of citizenship, justice and diversity as ethical situations experienced by engineering professionals.
2.   Students will formulate arguments about course themes through clear and persuasive writing, and verbal discussion.
GE Theme: Citizenship for a Just and Diverse World 
Goals Expected Learning Outcomes 
GOAL 1: Successful students will analyze an important topic or idea at a more advanced and in-depth level than in the Foundations component.
Successful students are able to:
1.1 Engage in critical and logical thinking about the topic or idea of the theme.
1.2 Engage in advanced, in-depth, scholarly exploration of the topic or idea of the theme.
GOAL 2: Successful students will integrate approaches to the theme by making connections to out-of-classroom experiences with academic knowledge or across disciplines and/or to work they have done in previous classes and that they anticipate doing in future.
Successful students are able to:
2.1 Identify, describe and synthesize approaches or experiences as they apply to the theme.
2.2 Demonstrate a developing sense of self as a learner through reflection, self-assessment and creative work, building on prior experiences to respond to new and challenging contexts.
GOAL 3: Successful students will explore and analyze a range of perspectives on local, national or global citizenship, and apply the knowledge, skills and dispositions that constitute citizenship.
Successful students are able to:
3.1 Describe and analyze a range of perspectives on what constitutes citizenship and how it differs across political, cultural, national, global, and/or historical communities
3.2 Identify, reflect on and apply the knowledge, skills and dispositions required for intercultural competence as a global citizen.
GOAL 4: Successful students will examine notions of justice amidst difference and analyze and critique how these interact with historically and socially constructed ideas of citizenship and membership within society, both within the United States and around the world.
Successful students are able to:
4.1 Examine, critique and evaluate various expressions and implications of diversity, equity and inclusion, and explore a variety of lived experiences.
4.2 Analyze a代 写PHIL 2332 A24 (35106) Engineering Ethics for a Just and Diverse World
代做程序编程语言nd critique the intersection of concepts of justice, difference, citizenship, and how these interact with cultural traditions, structures of power and/or advocacy for social change.
Students will satisfy these expected learning outcomes through close reading of assigned texts, active participation in class discussion, successful completion of written assignments, and critical engagement with fellow students and the instructor. More specifically, the course will:
1.   Require advanced-level engagement through a research project that formulates and responds to
an ethical quandary that lies at the intersection of diversity, equity, inclusion and justice within an engineering profession.
2.   Encourage reflection and self-assessment through a series of 10 short reading response papers   that ask students to reflect on how the readings inform. their own developing perspective on the (professional and personal) values that should inform. engineers as citizens of local, national, and/or global communities.
3.   Explicitly engages literature on citizenship and its relationship to democracy, pluralistic society, professional ethics, and a global perspective.
4.   Explicitly engage literature on justice, especially concerning what constitutes responsible engineering for a diverse and democratic society.
Course Requirements 
• Three Exams (50%)
There will be two in-person midterms (each worth 15% of your course grade) and an in-person final (worth 20% of your course grade).  The final exam is Friday, Dec 6th  at 4:00PM.  No materials can be used during the exams.
• Term Paper (30%)
You will synthesize your understanding of course materials and theme through a term paper in which you respond to an ethical quandary that lies at the intersection of diversity, equity, inclusion and justice within an engineering profession. You will be supplied with a set of quandaries and asked to choose one to respond to. Your formulation or response should reference at least three assigned readings. Your response should make an argument for what is at stake in the quandary and what should be done about it. “What should be done” can be specified in terms of the (range of) way(s) an engineer should respond and/or how professional ethics codes should be revised to more adequately advise on the matter. 
• Weekly Discussion Questions (10%):
The instructor will post discussion questions on Carmen most weeks throughout the semester.
The questions are designed to encourage students to think critically about important issues and to articulate their own thoughts on them.  Students must submit their typed responses in a Word document to Carmen and will have an opportunity to discuss them with the class.  Discussion questions are due (most) Tuesdays at 1:00PM.
• Class Participation (10%)
Philosophy requires active engagement.  Students should thoughtfully complete the readings ahead of time and come to class prepared to ask and answer questions and discuss important ideas with others.  The following activities may contribute to your participation grade: being present and on-time, not leaving during class, contributing to class discussion, asking questions about the material, not using one’s phone or computer, etc.  In an effort to foster class participation and reduce classroom distractions, please refrain from using laptops or tablets in class.  Phones should be out of sight and not on one’s desk.
